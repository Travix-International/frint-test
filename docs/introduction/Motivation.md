# Motivation

The package `frint-test` is build for serving our specific needs at [Travix International](http://travix.com).

At Travix one of the supported Front-end frameworks is [Frint](https://travix-international.github.io/frint/). Frint offers the flexibility that we need to support the development of modular applications using Javascript.  *frint-test* supports the development of Frint by providing utility test functions that allows Frint components to be tested using [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) or similar frameworks.

## Key goals

* Be the de facto framework used for testing Frint applications and components
* Abstract away third-party dependencies used by Frint, such as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and make tests simple
* Provide a reduced and clean API compatible with Frint
